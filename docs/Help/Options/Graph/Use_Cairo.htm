<h3>Use Cairo</h3>

<p>If true, the <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Graph_bar.htm">graph</a> is rendered with the Cairo graphics library, which is included in Graphviz. If you're having problems with the graph's text, enabling this option may help. Graphviz normally outputs high-level instructions in SVG format, which are then rendered by a web browser control. This is efficient, but it can cause problems with fonts. Enabling this option instructs Graphviz to convert fonts to lines and curves instead of relying on the web browser's fonts. This brute force solution greatly increases the size of the SVG files and may reduce graphing performance. Before enabling this option, consider that the most likely cause of <em>undersized</em> graph text is the system display scaling, and a specific fix is available for that, as explained <a href="../../Loose_Ends/Undersized_graph_text.htm">here</a>.
