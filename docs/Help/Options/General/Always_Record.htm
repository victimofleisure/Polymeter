<h3>Always Record</h3>

<p>If true, <a href="../../Concepts/Dubs.htm">dubs</a> are always recorded during playback, and the resultant recordings are saved automatically. Enabling this option prevents data loss due to forgetting to press <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Record.htm">Record</a>. The recordings are stored in the current user's profile, and named using a combination of the document title and the current date and time. For a user named foo, the destination folder would typically be:

<p>C:\Users\foo\AppData\Roaming\Polymeter
