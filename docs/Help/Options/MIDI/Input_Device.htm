<h3>Input Device</h3>

<p>This is the currently selected MIDI input device. Only one input device can be used at a time. The application doesn't require an input device, except for a few supplemental features such as <a href="../../Concepts/Mappings.htm">MIDI mapping</a> and <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Record_Tracks.htm">Record Tracks</a>.
