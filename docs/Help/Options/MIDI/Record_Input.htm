<tr><td>Dubs only</td><td>Only mute/unmute events, also known as <a href="../../Concepts/Dubs.htm">dubs</a>, are recorded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dubs + MIDI</td><td>Both dubs and MIDI data received from the <a href="../../Options/MIDI/Input_Device.htm">input device</a> are recorded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MIDI only</td><td>Only MIDI data received from the input device is recorded.</td></tr>
</table>
