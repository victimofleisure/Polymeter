<h3>Input Quantization</h3>

<p>This is the quantization for converting MIDI input to steps. It's used when <a href="../../Menus/File/Import.htm">importing</a> a MIDI file, and also by the <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Record_Tracks.htm">Record Tracks</a> command. It can be set to none, in which case the input is converted to the finest resolution available in the current <a href="../../Properties/Timebase.htm">timebase</a>, which is a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Quant">Quant</a> of one tick.
