<h3>Update Frequency</h3>

<p>This is the frequency at which the view is updated during playback, in Hertz (updates per second). It specifies the desired frame rate, but the actual frame rate may differ, depending on your hardware's capabilities. Windows that track <a href="../../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">song position</a> may animate more smoothly if you increase the frame rate, but CPU and/or GPU usage may also increase, so proceed cautiously.
