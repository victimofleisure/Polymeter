<h3>Live View Font Height</h3>

<p>This is the height of the <a href="../../Views/Live_View.htm">Live View</a> font, in pixels. Making the font smaller fits more rows in the live view's lists of presets and tracks, which may let you avoid scrolling the lists, at the cost of making them harder to read. Another way to avoid scrolling is by grouping related tracks into <a href="../../Concepts/Parts.htm">parts</a>.
