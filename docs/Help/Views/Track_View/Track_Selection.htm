<h3>Track Selection</h3>

<p>Many commands operate on selected <a href="../../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>. You can select tracks in one of two ways: by selecting rows in the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm">track grid</a>, or by right-clicking <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">track mute</a> buttons.

<p>To use the first method, left-click in the track number column, which has a number sign (#) in the list header. This is usually the grid's leftmost column, unless you've reordered the columns. You can also select multiple rows, and select via the keyboard; for more help with selecting, see <a href="../../Concepts/List_controls.htm">list controls</a>.

<p>You can also select tracks via their mute buttons, which are located immediately to the right of the vertical divider that separates the two panes of the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">track view</a>.

<ul>
<li>To toggle the selection of an individual track, right-click its mute button.
<li>To toggle the selection of a range of adjacent tracks, right-click over the first track's mute button, and while keeping the right mouse button pressed, move the pointer vertically until it's over the last track's mute button.
<li>To clear the track selection, use the <a href="../../Menus/Edit/Deselect.htm">Deselect</a> command, or right-click within the ruler at the top of the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Steps.htm">track steps</a> area.
</ul>

<p>Some commands can operate on either a track selection or a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">step selection</a>. For such commands, if a step selection exists, it has priority over the track selection, meaning the track selection is ignored in that case.
