<h3>Track Mutes</h3>

<p>Each track has a mute switch, which determines whether the track is enabled or disabled. Muting applies to all <a href="../../Concepts/Tracks.htm#Track_types">track types</a>, and can be modulated via <a href="../../Modulation/Mute_modulation.htm">mute modulation</a>. Muting a <a href="../../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm">note track</a> only prevents it from starting <em>new</em> notes; any notes that were already in progress when the track was muted continue until they finish their durations.

<p>Muting is done via the track mute buttons, which are located immediately to the right of the vertical divider that separates the two panes of the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">track view</a>. If a track is muted, its mute button is red, otherwise it's green. To toggle the mute state of a single track (from unmuted to muted or vice versa), simply left-click the track's mute button. To toggle the mute states of multiple tracks, first <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">select</a> them, and then left-click anywhere within the mute buttons area, or use the <a href="../../Menus/Track/Mute.htm">Track/Mute</a> command.

<p>To unconditionally mute the selected tracks, regardless of their current mute state, left-click anywhere within the mute buttons area while pressing the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key.
