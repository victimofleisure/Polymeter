<h3>Views</h3>

<p>The application supports three top-level views, as shown below. Each view is optimized for a different stage of the <a href="../Concepts/Polymeter.htm">polymeter</a> composing process.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>View</th><th>Purpose</th>
<tr><td><a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">Track</a></td><td>Use for composing <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>. This is the most feature-rich view, with an entire chapter devoted to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Views/Song_View.htm">Song</a></td><td>Use for arranging tracks into a <a href="../Concepts/Songs.htm">song</a>, or refining an arrangement that was <a href="../Menus/Transport/Record.htm">recorded</a> while performing in Live view.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Views/Live_View.htm">Live</a></td><td>Use for live-arranging or performing with tracks. The performance can be recorded as a sequence of <a href="../Concepts/Dubs.htm">dubs</a>, and the resulting arrangement can be refined in Song view.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To switch between the different views, use the View menu's Track, Song, and Live commands or their keyboard shortcuts. Normally only one view is shown at a time. To show multiple views at once, <a href="../Menus/Window/New_Window.htm#Splits">split</a> the view area into two or more tab groups.

<a name="Song_Mode"><p><b>Song Mode</b></a>
<p>Which view is shown can affect <a href="../Menus/Transport/Play.htm">playback</a>. If song view is shown, the sequencer operates in <em>song mode</em>, which means that tracks are automatically muted and unmuted to reflect the <a href="../Concepts/Songs.htm">arrangement</a>. If <a href="../Menus/Window/New_Window.htm#Splits">multiple views</a> are shown, which view is <em>active</em> determines whether song mode is in effect. When you enter song mode, the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">track mutes</a> snap to appropriate states based on your <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">position</a> within the song.
