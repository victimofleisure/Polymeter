<h3>Live View</h3>

<p>The live <a href="../Views/Views.htm">view</a> makes it easier to perform a live arrangement of your <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>. While it's also possible to perform in <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">track view</a>, live view has advantages, as explained below. To display the live view, use the View menu's <a href="../Menus/View/Show_Live_View.htm">Live</a> command.

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="../Menus/Transport/Record.htm">record</a> your live arrangement while you're performing it. Your arrangement decisions are recorded as a sequence of <a href="../Concepts/Dubs.htm">dubs</a>, also known as a <a href="../Concepts/Songs.htm">song</a>. Recording a live arrangement can be more intuitive than creating an arrangement via editing in <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm">song view</a>.
<li>You can reduce the number of tracks shown in live view by <a href="../Menus/Track/Create_Group.htm">grouping</a> related tracks together into <a href="../Concepts/Parts.htm">parts</a>. It's easier to arrange fewer elements, and shortening the track list can also avoid time-consuming scrolling. You may also be able to avoid scrolling by using a <a href="../Options/View/Live_View_Font_Height.htm">smaller font</a>.
<li>Live view has a much simpler interface than track view, with less distractions, which helps you concentrate on performing.
<li>Live view supports a two-stage ready/go process, which lets you prepare a multi-track transition and then execute it, using only one hand, leaving your other hand free to operate a control surface, for example; see below.
<li>Tracks can't be edited in live view, so you needn't worry about inadvertently modifying your tracks while performing.
</ul>

<p>Live view features two lists. The left list contains your <a href="../Concepts/Presets.htm">presets</a>, and the right list contains your tracks and parts. In live view, tracks that belong to a part are hidden; the part's name is listed as a substitute for its member tracks. A part's position in live view is determined by the position of its first member track in track view.

<p>In the track list, muted items are orange, and unmuted items are green. To toggle an item from muted to unmuted or vice versa, left-click it. To mute an item regardless of its current state, left-click it while pressing the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key.

<p>Items can also be selected via the right mouse button, and then toggled or muted all at once via the left mouse button, in a two-stage process, similarly to the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">track mutes</a>. This lets you prepare a multi-track transition and then execute it, using only one hand. Selected items are highlighted using dark text on a light background. To toggle the selection of an item, right-click it. To toggle the selection of a group of adjacent items, right-click the group's first item, and then while keeping the right mouse button pressed, drag the pointer to the group's last item. To deselect all items, right-click in the area to the right of the track list. If a selection exists, left-clicking anywhere within the view toggles or mutes the selected items, depending on whether the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key is down. The selected items can also be soloed, using the solo button at the top of the view.

<p>The presets list works somewhat differently. To apply a preset, left-click the corresponding item. To select a preset, right-click the corresponding item. If a preset is selected, left-clicking anywhere in the view applies the preset. Only one preset can be applied or selected at a time.

<p>Live view shows a progress bar for each track list item. Each progress bar indicates the current position within the corresponding track or part. If a part's member tracks have different <a href="../Loose_Ends/Period.htm">periods</a>, its progress bar corresponds to the longest period.

<p>If your arrangement is complex, you may prefer to record each section separately, instead of trying to get all the sections right in one take. To append a new section, move the <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">song position</a> to the end of the last completed section before you start recording. Your live arrangement can be approximate, because you can refine its transitions later in song view.

<p>It's a good idea to record your rehearsals, in case there's a happy accident. You may want to use the <a href="../Options/General/Always_Record.htm">Always Record</a> option, so that you can't accidentally fail to record a perfect take. In order to further reduce visual clutter, it's recommended to use live view in <a href="../Menus/Window/Full_Screen.htm">full screen</a> mode.
