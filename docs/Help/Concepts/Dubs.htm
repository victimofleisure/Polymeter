<h3>Dubs</h3>

<p>A dub is an <a href="../Loose_Ends/Audio_versus_events.htm">event</a> that consists of one or more <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a> being <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">muted</a> or unmuted at a particular time. Dubs are useful for arranging tracks into a <a href="../Concepts/Songs.htm">song</a>, which is essentially a sequence of dubs. You can create dubs by drawing them in <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm">song view</a>, but it's often easier to create them by <a href="../Menus/Transport/Record.htm">recording</a> an arrangement that you perform in <a href="../Views/Live_View.htm">live view</a>.

<p>Dubs don't support fading. To fade a track in or out, either  create a <a href="../Modulation/Velocity_modulation.htm">velocity modulation</a> that targets the track, or create a <a href="../Tracks/Controller_tracks.htm">controller track</a> that changes the instrument's volume (typically controller number seven). These fader tracks can also be dubbed in and out, like any other track. Another option is to use a MIDI control surface to change instrument volumes live, and capture the control changes by <a href="../Loose_Ends/Recording_MIDI_input.htm">recording MIDI input</a>. If you're <a href="../Menus/File/Export.htm">exporting</a> your sequence to another music software, you may prefer to create fades within that software, as it may have better automation support.
