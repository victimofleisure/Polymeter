<h3>Dubs</h3>

<p>A dub is an event that consists of one or more <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a> being <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">muted</a> or unmuted at a particular time. Dubs are useful for arranging tracks into a <a href="../Concepts/Songs.htm">song</a>, which is essentially a series of dubs. You can create dubs by drawing them in <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm">song view</a>, but it's often easier to create them by <a href="../Menus/Transport/Record.htm">recording</a> an arrangement that you perform in <a href="../Views/Live_View.htm">live view</a>.
