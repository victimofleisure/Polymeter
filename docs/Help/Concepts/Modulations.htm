<h3>Modulations</h3>

<p>Besides juxtaposition, another important method of combining <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a> is <em>modulation</em>, in which a track alters the behavior of another track. The track that does the modulating is called the modulator or <em>source</em>, whereas the track that's being modulated is called the target or <em>sink</em>. Modulations are created via the <a href="../Docking_Windows/Modulations_bar.htm">modulations bar</a> or the Track menu's <a href="../Menus/Track/Create_Modulation.htm">Modulation</a> command. There are many types of modulation, and they vary in terms of the targets they support, and how they interpret step values, as shown below.

<a name="Modulation_types"><p><b>Modulation types</b></a>
<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Targets</th><th>Effect</th><th>Step</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Mute_modulation.htm">Mute</a></td><td>All</td><td>Mutes or unmutes target</td><td>Boolean; non-zero value mutes target</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Note_modulation.htm">Note</a></td><td>Note tracks, scale modulators, chord modulators</td><td>Offsets note or tone</td><td>Signed offset in semitones or scale tones</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Velocity_modulation.htm">Velocity</a></td><td>All <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm#Track_types">track types</a> except Tempo and Modulator</td><td>Offsets note velocity or controller value</td><td>Signed MIDI data offset</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Duration_modulation.htm">Duration</a></td><td>Note tracks only</td><td>Offsets note duration</td><td>Signed offset in ticks</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Range_modulation.htm">Range</a></td><td>Note tracks only</td><td>Offsets range start</td><td>Signed offset in semitones</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Position_modulation.htm">Position</a></td><td>All</td><td>Rotates step array</td><td>Signed rotation in steps</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Tempo_modulation.htm">Tempo</a></td><td><a href="../Tracks/Tempo_tracks.htm">Tempo tracks</a> only</td><td>Scales tempo</td><td>Signed fractional tempo change</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Scale_modulation.htm">Scale</a></td><td>Note tracks only</td><td>Adds note to current scale</td><td>Signed note offset in semitones</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Chord_modulation.htm">Chord</a></td><td>Note tracks only</td><td>Adds scale tone to current chord</td><td>Signed zero-based scale tone index</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Index_modulation.htm">Index</a></td><td>Note tracks only</td><td>Picks a scale or chord tone</td><td>Signed zero-based scale or chord tone index</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Voicing_modulation.htm">Voicing</a></td><td>Note tracks only</td><td>Drops or raises a scale or chord tone</td><td>Signed one-based voice index</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../Modulation/Offset_modulation.htm">Offset</a></td><td>All track types except Tempo</td><td>Offsets playback timing</td><td>Offset in ticks; unsigned for Note or Controller, signed for Modulator</td>
</table>

<a name="Modulation_relationships"><p><b>Modulation relationships</b></a>
<p>The relationship between source and target tracks can be any of the following:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Relationship</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>One to one</td><td>A single source modulating a single target</td></tr>
<tr><td>One to many</td><td>A single source modulating multiple targets</td></tr>
<tr><td>Many to one</td><td>Multiple sources modulating a single target</td></tr>
<tr><td>Many to many</td><td>Multiple sources modulating multiple targets</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the above relationships, the modulations don't necessarily have to be all of the same type. For example a note track could have its mute state modulated by one source track, and its note modulated by a different source track.

<a name="Nested_modulation"><p><b>Nested modulation</b></a>
<p>Nested relationships are also possible, in other words a modulator can modulate a modulator, though there are limits on this, as explained below. The only thing that's definitely not allowed is a track modulating itself, either directly, or indirectly via a loop, as this would lead to infinite recursion. The user interface tries to prevent self-modulation, but if it occurs you'll get the error message "Modulation exceeded the maximum number of recursions." The maximum modulation depth is 32 levels, however only <a href="../Modulation/Mute_modulation.htm">mute</a>, <a href="../Modulation/Position_modulation.htm">position</a>, and <a href="../Modulation/Offset_modulation.htm">offset</a> modulation fully support nesting. The modulation types that fully support nesting can form chains, for example:

<p>mute modulator &rarr; position modulator &rarr; note modulator &rarr; note track

<a name="Modulation_rules"><p><b>Modulation rules</b></a>
<p>The table below summarizes the supported modulation behavior. For each track type, it tells you what types of modulation the track can be targeted by. Use the <a href="../Menus/Tools/Check_Modulations.htm">Check Modulations</a> command to verify that your modulations comply with these rules.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Target track type</th><th>Supported modulation types</th></tr>
<tr><td>Note</td><td>All except Tempo</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key Aftertouch, Control, Patch, Channel Aftertouch, Wheel, Internal</td><td>Mute, Velocity, Position, Offset, Length</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tempo</td><td>Mute, Position, Tempo, Length</td></tr>
<tr><td>Modulator</td><td>Mute, Position, Offset, Length; also Note but only if target is a Scale or Chord modulator</td></tr>
</table>
