<h3>List controls</h3>

<p>The application makes frequent use of lists, some of which are editable <a href="../Concepts/Grid_controls.htm">grid controls</a>. Within a list, rows can be selected either via the mouse, or via the keyboard.

<a name="Selecting_rows_via_mouse"><p><b>Selecting rows via mouse</b></a>
<ul>
<li>To select a single row, left-click it.
<li>To select a range of adjacent rows, left-click the range's first row, press and hold down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key, left-click the range's last row, and then release the <span class="key">Shift</span> key. If the range is large, you may need to scroll the list in between selecting its first and last rows.
<li>To add or remove a row to or from an existing selection, left-click the row while pressing the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key.
<li>To deselect all rows, left-click below the last row, or to the right of the last column.
</ul>

<a name="Selecting_rows_via_keyboard"><p><b>Selecting rows via keyboard</b></a>
<p>You can also select list rows via the keyboard, using the up/down arrow keys, possibly in combination with other keys.

<ul>
<li>To select a single row, repeatedly press (or press and hold) the up or down arrow key until the desired row is selected. Doing so navigates through the list by moving the single selection from row to row, scrolling the list if necessary. You can also use the <span class="key">Page Up</span>, <span class="key">Page Down</span>, <span class="key">Home</span>, and <span class="key">End</span> keys to navigate through the list more rapidly.
<li>To select a range of adjacent rows, do the same as for a single row, but while pressing the <span class="key">Shift</span> key.
<li>To add or remove a row to or from an existing selection, first navigate to the desired row as described above, but while pressing the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key. This moves the list selection mark (usually a dotted rectangular outline) without disrupting the existing selection. When the selection mark is on the desired item, press <span class="key">Ctrl+Alt+Space</span> to toggle the item's selection state. The <span class="key">Alt</span> key is necessary because <span class="key">Ctrl+Space</span> is reserved for the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Play.htm">Play</a> command.
</ul>
