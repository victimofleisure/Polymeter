<h3>Presets</h3>

<p>A preset is a snapshot of the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">mute</a> states of all the <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>. Applying a preset mutes or unmutes tracks as needed, so that after it's applied, the same tracks are muted as when the preset was created. Presets are especially useful for creating section changes, because applying a single preset is easier than muting or unmuting many tracks at once.
