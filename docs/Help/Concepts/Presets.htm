<h3>Presets</h3>

<p>A preset is a snapshot of the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">mute</a> states of all the <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>. Applying a preset mutes or unmutes tracks as needed, so that after it's applied, the same tracks are muted as when the preset was created. Presets are especially useful for creating section changes, because applying a single preset is easier than muting or unmuting many tracks at once.

<p>Presets are edited using the <a href="../Docking_Windows/Presets_bar.htm">Presets bar</a>. To create a new preset, use the Track menu's <a href="../Menus/Track/Create_Preset.htm">Preset</a> command. A new preset initially has an automatically generated name, but you can rename it.

<p>To update an existing preset, in other words to change its snapshot, do as follows:

<ol>
<li>Apply the preset, either by double-clicking the preset's item within the preset list, or by right-clicking the preset's list item and then using the Apply command on the Preset bar's <a href="../Docking_Windows/Presets_bar.htm#Presets_context_menu">context menu</a>.
<li>In the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">track view</a>, mute or unmute tracks as desired.
<li>Right-click the preset's list item and use the Update command on the Preset bar's context menu.
</ol>
