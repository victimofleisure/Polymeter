<h3>Offset modulation</h3>

<p>Offset <a href="../Concepts/Modulations.htm">modulation</a> changes the time offset of a target note track. An offset modulator's steps are interpreted as unsigned delays in MIDI <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>. By default, notes can only be made later, not earlier, but you can work around this by setting the target track's <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Offset">offset</a> to a negative value. For example if the target track's offset is &minus;64, that gives its offset modulation an effective range of &minus;64 to +63, in other words from 64 ticks early to 63 ticks late.

<p>Offset modulation changes the rhythmic feel of the target track, periodically speeding it up and slowing it down relative to the beat. It can be used to create rolls on drums, or to emulate the feel changes of a live performer. For best results, use a smooth function such as a ramp, triangle or sine wave. Only <a href="../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm">note tracks</a> support offset modulation.
