<h3>Range modulation</h3>

<p>In range <a href="../Concepts/Modulations.htm">modulation</a>, a track's notes are transposed by one or more octaves as needed to keep them within a specified range. The size of the range is typically one octave, though other sizes are possible. For range modulation to be effective, the target track's <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Range_Type">range type</a> must be set to a value other than None.

<p>The range is movable, and its bottom note is specified by the target track's <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Range_Start">Range Start</a> property, which can also be altered by one or more modulator tracks. A range modulator track is interpreted as an array of <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Unsigned_versus_signed_steps">signed</a> offsets in semitones, which are added to the target track's range start note. If a target track has multiple range modulators, they're summed.

<p>Because the transposition is by octaves only, the notes remain in the same scale and key; only their octaves are affected. If several tracks forming a chord are range modulated together, the chord cycles through its possible inversions.
