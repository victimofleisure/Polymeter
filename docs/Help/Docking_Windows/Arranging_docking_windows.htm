<h3>Arranging docking windows</h3>

<p><a href="../Docking_Windows/Docking_windows.htm">Docking windows</a> can be arranged in various ways to suit your taste. The arrangement determines how much space remains for viewing and editing the document. The following options are just some of the ways that docking windows can be arranged:

<ul>
<li>Dock windows to the edge of a frame.
<li>Tab-dock windows together with other windows.
<li>Float windows over or outside the application.
<li>Hide windows along the edge of the application.
<li>Display windows on different monitors.
<li>Reset window placement to the default layout.
</ul>

<p>Docking windows can be arranged by dragging, by using commands on the Window menu, and by right-clicking the title bar of the window to be arranged.

<a name="Floating_windows"><p><b>Floating windows</b></a>
<p>You can undock a window from its default location in the application and move that window anywhere on the desktop or to another monitor. You can dock multiple windows together in a "raft" and then move them as a unit anywhere on the desktop or to another monitor.

<p>To position a window outside the application:
<ul>
<li>Drag the window to the location you want.
</ul>

<p>To return a window to its most recent docked location:
<ul>
<li>Double-click the title bar of the window.
</ul>

<p>Docking windows can be fastened to one side of a frame in the application or within the editing frame. A guide diamond appears when you drag a window to another location to help you to easily re-dock the window.

<p>To dock windows:
<ul>
<li>Click the title bar of the window you want to dock.
<li>Drag the window toward the middle of the application. Tip: To move a dockable window without snapping it into place, press the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key while you drag the window. A guide diamond appears. The four arrows of the diamond point toward the four sides of the target pane. An additional four arrows point to the four edges of the application.
<li>When the window you are dragging reaches the location where you want to dock it, move the pointer over the corresponding portion of the guide diamond. The designated area is shaded.
<li>To dock the window in the position indicated, release the mouse button.
</ul>

<p>For example, if the properties bar is docked on the right edge of the application and you want to dock it on the left edge, drag it toward the middle of the application, move the pointer over the far left arrow of the guide diamond, and then release the mouse button.

<p>A floating window can be maximized to cover the entire screen. To maximize a floating window, select the Maximize item from its Window menu. To restore a maximized window to its previous size and location, select the Restore item from its Window menu.

<a name="Auto_hide"><p><b>Auto hide</b></a>
<p>Docking windows support a feature called Auto Hide. Auto Hide causes a window to slide out of the way when you use a different window. When a window is auto-hidden, its name appears on a tab at the edge of the application. To use the window again, point to the tab so that the window slides back into view.

<p>To use Auto Hide:
<ul>
<li>On the menu bar, choose Window, Auto Hide to turn Auto Hide on or off. As an alternative, you can click the pushpin icon on the title bar of the window.
</ul>

<p>Docking windows that have Auto Hide enabled may temporarily slide into view when the window has focus. To hide the window again, select an item outside of the current window. When the window loses focus, it slides back out of view.

<a name="Specifying_a_Monitor"><p><b>Specifying a Monitor</b></a>
<p>If you have a second <a href="../Menus/Window/New_Window.htm#Multiple_monitors">monitor</a> and your operating system supports it, you can choose which monitor displays a window. You can even group multiple windows together in "rafts" on other monitors.

<p>To move windows to different monitors:
<ul>
<li>Use the Display settings in the Control Panel to set up a multiple monitor configuration.
<li>In the application, drag the window to the other monitor.
</ul>

<a name="Resetting_window_layouts"><p><b>Resetting window layouts</b></a>
<p>You can return the application to the original window layout by using the <a href="../Menus/Window/Reset_Layout.htm">Window/Reset Layout</a> command.
