<h3>Step Values</h3>

<p>This <a href="../Docking_Windows/Docking_windows.htm">docking window</a> lets you edit <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm">step</a> values numerically, using a <a href="../Concepts/Grid_controls.htm">grid control</a>. In some cases this may be more convenient than dragging velocity bars in the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Velocities_Pane.htm">Velocities pane</a>. It's particularly useful for editing <a href="../Modulation/Note_modulation.htm">note modulator</a> tracks and similar cases.

<p>Step values are shown for the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a> only. Note that selecting a large number of tracks at once may cause the Step Values window to perform poorly. It's recommended to hide the Step Values window when it's not needed.

<p>This bar supports the <a href="../Menus/Edit/Standard_editing_commands.htm">standard editing commands</a>, allowing selected rows to be copied, cut, pasted, deleted and inserted. Selected rows can also be moved by left-clicking and dragging them. Note however that these commands are only supported if the selection is <a href="../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">rectangular</a>, meaning its rows are contiguous and all contain the same number of steps. This may not be the case if the selected tracks have different lengths. Although the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Steps.htm">track steps</a> area also supports the standard editing commands, editing may be easier in the Step Values bar because it shows the contents of the steps.

<p>For each selected track, the step value corresponding to the current <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">song position</a> is highlighted in red or green depending on whether the track is <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Mutes.htm">muted</a>. To move the song position to a particular step within a selected track, left-click the step value while pressing the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key.

<a name="Step_values_display_formats"><p><b>Display formats</b></a>
<p>Various display formats can be selected using the window's <a href="../Docking_Windows/Step_Values_bar.htm#Step_values_context_menu">context menu</a>. If Signed is enabled, the steps are interpreted as <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Unsigned_versus_signed_steps">signed</a> values from &minus;64 to +64, otherwise they're considered unsigned values. If Notes is enabled, the steps are displayed as notes, with or without octave information, depending on whether Octaves is enabled. If Ties is enabled, the <a href="../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm#Tied_notes">tied note</a> bit (the MSB) is included, otherwise it's masked off; this is an advanced feature, as is Hexadecimal display.
