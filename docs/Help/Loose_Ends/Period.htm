<h3>Period</h3>

<p>An oscillation can be described in two ways. One can specify how many cycles it makes per second, also known as its <em>frequency</em>, or one can specify how long each of its cycles takes in seconds, also known as its <em>period</em>. Frequency and period are inverses of each other: frequency equals one divided by period, just as period equals one divided by frequency. For example, a frequency of two cycles per second is equivalent to a period of half a second.

<p>In this application, a <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">track</a> is analogous to an oscillator, in that it cycles sequentially through its <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm">steps</a>. A track's period, meaning how long it takes to complete one cycle, is the product of its <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Length">Length</a> in steps, and the duration of each step, also known as the track's <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Quant">Quant</a>. Because step duration is measured in <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>, a track's period is also measured in ticks. For example, a track that's five steps long and has a quant of 30 has a period of 5 &times; 30 = 150 ticks.
