<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Polymeter is a specialized MIDI sequencer for composing music in <a href="../Concepts/Polymeter.htm">polymeter</a>, meaning music that uses multiple meters simultaneously. The application doesn't generate audio directly, instead it outputs a stream of MIDI messages to a <a href="../Options/MIDI/Output_Device.htm">device</a> that converts MIDI to audio, such as a hardware or software synthesizer. By default, the application outputs to the GS Wavetable Synth that ships with Windows. The application also <a href="../Menus/File/Export.htm">exports</a> a Standard MIDI file that can be imported into most music software.

<p>A Polymeter document consists of an array of <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>, each of which produces a single MIDI note or control message at a time. Each track has its own <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Length">length</a> and loops independently through its own array of equal-sized <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm">steps</a>. For <a href="../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm">note tracks</a>, the steps determine the starting times, durations, and velocities of notes, but steps are interpreted differently for other <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm#Track_types">track types</a>. Tracks of differing lengths can be juxtaposed, and then edited while they're looping. Tracks can also <a href="../Concepts/Modulations.htm">modulate</a> other tracks, and can be arranged into <a href="../Concepts/Songs.htm">songs</a>.

<p>The application features multiple <a href="../Views/Views.htm">views</a>, corresponding to different stages of the composing process, and various <a href="../Docking_Windows/Docking_windows.htm">docking windows</a>. Most application parameters can be remotely controlled by <a href="../Concepts/Mappings.htm">mapping</a> them to MIDI messages.
