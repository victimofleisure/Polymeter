<h3>Meter</h3>

<p>This is the number of beats in a measure. It determines how <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">song positions</a> are displayed throughout the application. If meter is one, song positions are displayed as beats and <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>, whereas if meter is greater than one, song positions are displayed as measures, beats and ticks (also known as MBT). Meter is one by default, and can't be less than one. Meter is purely cosmetic, in the sense that changing it has no effect on the application's MIDI output. Meter affects how the current position is displayed in the <a href="../Menus/View/Status_Bar.htm">status bar</a>, and also affects the display of <a href="../Properties/Start_Position.htm">Start Position</a>, <a href="../Properties/Loop_From.htm">Loop From</a>, and <a href="../Properties/Loop_To.htm">Loop To</a>.

<p>Since <a href="../Concepts/Polymeter.htm">polymeter</a> is the use of multiple meters at once, it might seem pointless to specify a meter, but it can still be useful to change how song positions are displayed, particularly if your composition emphasizes one meter more than others.

<a name="Song_position"><p><b>Song position</b></a>
<p>A song position is a location within the output MIDI sequence. Song positions are maintained internally in <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>, but they're displayed either as beats and ticks, or as measures, beats and ticks (also known as MBT), depending on the <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm">Meter</a> property. Ticks are zero-based, whereas both beats and measures are one-based, hence a song position of zero ticks is displayed as 1:000 if meter is one, or 1:1:000 if meter is greater than one.

<p>Song positions are unaffected by the <a href="../Properties/Tempo.htm">tempo</a>. But if a song position is converted to a time, the resulting time does depend on the tempo. The <a href="../Menus/View/Status_Bar.htm">status bar</a> shows the current position in both measures, beats, and ticks on the left, and time on the right.

<p>The following table shows the effect of some common meters on various positions in ticks, assuming the default <a href="../Properties/Timebase.htm">timebase</a> of 120 ticks per beat. The asymmetry in how negative positions are displayed is due to measures and beats being one-based.

<a name="Navigating_within_a_song"><p><b>Navigating within a song</b></a>
<p>To move the <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">song position</a> to a specific location, use one of these methods:

<ul>
<li>In the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm">track grid</a> or <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm#Song_Grid">song grid</a>, left-click the desired location in the ruler at the top of the view.
<li>To move to the <a href="../Properties/Start_Position.htm">start position</a>, use the Transport menu's <a href="../Menus/Transport/Rewind.htm">Rewind</a> command.
<li>To specify the desired location numerically, use the Transport menu's <a href="../Menus/Transport/Go_To_Position.htm">Go To Position</a> command.
<li>To move to the nearest <a href="../Concepts/Convergences.htm">convergence</a>, use the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Next_Convergence.htm">Next Convergence</a> and <a href="../Menus/Transport/Previous_Convergence.htm">Previous Convergence</a> commands on the Transport menu, or their keyboard shortcuts: <span class="key">Alt+Right</span> for next convergence, or <span class="key">Alt+Left</span> for previous convergence.
<li>In the <a href="../Docking_Windows/Step_Values_bar.htm">Step Values bar</a>, left-click a step value to move to the corresponding location.
<li>In <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm">Song view</a> only, use <span class="key">Shift+Right</span> to move to the next <a href="../Concepts/Dubs.htm">dub</a>, or <span class="key">Shift+Left</span> to move to the previous dub.
</ul>
