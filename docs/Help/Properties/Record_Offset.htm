<h3>Record Offset</h3>

<p>This offset is added to the times of recorded MIDI events during playback. It's specified in <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>. It allows you compensate for latency during recording, by playing recorded MIDI events later (positive offset) or earlier (negative offset), relative to the playback of <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a>. For details, see <a href="../Loose_Ends/Recording_MIDI_input.htm">Recording MIDI Input</a>.
