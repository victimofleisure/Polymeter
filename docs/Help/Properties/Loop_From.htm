<h3>Loop From</h3>

<p>If playback is <a href="../Menus/Transport/Loop.htm">looped</a>, this is the starting position of the loop. It's displayed either in beats and <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>, or in measures, beats and ticks, depending on the <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm">Meter</a> property. The ending position is given by the <a href="../Properties/Loop_To.htm">Loop To</a> property. The starting position must be less than the ending position, otherwise no looping occurs.

<p>Instead of entering the loop positions numerically, you can alternatively create a <a href="../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">step selection</a> before using the Loop command. In that case the step selection's first and last steps determine the loop's starting and ending positions respectively. In the <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm#Song_Grid">song grid</a>, a loop can similarly be specified by selecting a range of cells and then using the Loop command.

<p>If a valid loop exists, it's indicated by a highlighted area in the rulers at the top of the <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Steps.htm">track steps</a> and song grid. The loop's range can be modified by horizontally dragging the left or right edge of this highlighted area.
