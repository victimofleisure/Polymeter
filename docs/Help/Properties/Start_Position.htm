<h3>Start Position</h3>

<p>This is the <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm#Song_position">position</a> at which the song starts. It determines the <a href="../Views/Song_View.htm">Song view</a>'s left margin, and the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Rewind.htm">Rewind</a> command's destination. It's displayed either in beats and <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>, or in measures, beats and ticks, depending on the <a href="../Properties/Meter.htm">Meter</a> property.

<p>Negative start positions are allowed, and this may be useful because a full <a href="../Concepts/Convergences.htm">convergence</a> is guaranteed at position zero (1:000). By starting at a negative time, you effectively move this initial convergence to later in your song.
