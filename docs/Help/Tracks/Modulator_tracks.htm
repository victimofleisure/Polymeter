<h3>Modulator tracks</h3>

<p>A modulator track is simply a track that alters the behavior of another track, in a process called <a href="../Concepts/Modulations.htm">modulation</a>. To make a modulator track operational, you must connect it to one or more target tracks, via the <a href="../Docking_Windows/Modulations_bar.htm">Modulations bar</a> or the Track menu's <a href="../Menus/Track/Create_Modulation.htm">Modulation</a> command. In most cases, you'll want to prevent a modulator track from outputting MIDI messages, which you can do by changing its <a href="../Concepts/Tracks.htm#Track_types">track type</a> to "Modulator." A modulator track's <a href="../Concepts/Steps.htm">steps</a> typically contain values that only make sense in the context of a particular <a href="../Concepts/Modulations.htm#Modulation_types">modulation type</a>, in which case also interpreting those same step values as note velocities or controllers would be unhelpful. One possible exception is a <a href="../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm">note track</a> gating another note track via <a href="../Modulation/Mute_modulation.htm">mute modulation</a>, in order to prevent collisions between them. But in general, creating separate "Modulator" type tracks is the most flexible method of setting up modulation sources.

<p>It's recommended to give modulator tracks a small negative time <a href="../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Offset">offset</a>, so that they're slightly ahead of their targets. This avoids races and track order dependencies.
