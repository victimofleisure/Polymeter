<h3>Velocity Range</h3>

<p>This command reports the minimum and maximum step values in the selected <a href="../../Concepts/Tracks.htm">tracks</a> or <a href="../../Concepts/Steps.htm">steps</a>. The command also checks for <a href="../../Loose_Ends/Clipping.htm">clipping</a>, which can be caused by excessive <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Velocity">track velocity</a> or <a href="../../Modulation/Velocity_modulation.htm">velocity modulation</a>. If a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">step selection</a> exists, it takes priority, and only the selected steps are included. Otherwise all steps of the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a> are included. The step values are interpreted as unsigned integers from 0 to 127, regardless of <a href="../../Concepts/Tracks.htm#Track_types">track type</a>. When applied to <a href="../../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm">note tracks</a>, the command reports velocities, but for other track types, the meaning depends on the context.
