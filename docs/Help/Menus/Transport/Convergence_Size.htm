<h3>Convergence Size</h3>

<p>This submenu lets you choose a convergence size for the <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Next_Convergence.htm">Next Convergence</a> and <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Previous_Convergence.htm">Previous Convergence</a> commands. Convergence size is the minimum number of unique loop lengths that must reach their start point simultaneously for it to count as a <a href="../../Concepts/Convergences.htm">convergence</a>. The size lets you filter the convergences by significance, finding only those where at least the specified number of different lengths converge, while skipping over the lesser ones. At the default size of two, the commands find every partial or full convergence. To find only three-way or higher convergences, set the convergence size to three. To find only full convergences, set the convergence size to All, but note that doing so may slow down the search if many large, <a href="../../Loose_Ends/Primes.htm">relatively prime</a> lengths are in use.

<p>If the desired size isn't listed in the submenu, select Custom to display a dialog that lets you enter other sizes. The size can be set as low as one, in which case the next/previous convergence commands find every time when a loop starts, regardless of whether other loops also start at that time. To display a list of convergences, use the <a href="../../Menus/Tools/Convergences_Calculator.htm">Convergences</a> command.
