<h3>New Window</h3>

<p>Use this command to open a new window with the same contents as the active window. You can open multiple document windows to display different parts or views of a document at the same time. If you change the contents in one window, all other windows containing the same document reflect those changes. When you open a new window, it becomes the active window and is displayed on top of all other open windows.

<a name="Splits"><p><b>Splits</b></a>
<p>You can split the view area horizontally or vertically into two or more tab groups. This lets you show multiple documents at once, which can be useful for comparing them. Splitting also lets you work with multiple views of a single document at the same time. For example, instead of switching back and forth between <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">track view</a> and <a href="../../Views/Song_View.htm">song view</a>, you may prefer to show your document in both views at once. To create another view of the active document, use the <a href="../../Menus/Window/New_Window.htm">New Window</a> command.

<p>For splitting to work, you must have at least two tabs in the same tab group. The tabs can correspond to different documents, or to different views of the same document. Activate whichever tab you wish to move, and then use either the <a href="../../Menus/Window/New_Horizontal_Tab_Group.htm">New Horizontal Tab Group</a> or <a href="../../Menus/Window/New_Vertical_Tab_Group.htm">New Vertical Tab Group</a> command to create an alternate tab group. The active view is automatically moved into the newly created tab group.

<p>You can also left-click a tab, drag it, and drop it within the view area of a tab group. If you drop it within the tab group it already belongs to, a new split is created, and the active view is moved to the new tab group. If you drop it within a different tab group, the active view is moved to that tab group. Removing the last tab from a tab group also removes the corresponding split if any.

<p>You can create as many tab groups as you want provided they all have the same orientation, in other words you can't mix horizontal and vertical tab groups. To change the proportions of two tab groups, left-click and drag the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm#Panes">splitter bar</a> that separates them.

<p>If you create the initial split by dragging a tab, the drop location determines whether the split is vertical or horizontal. The split will be vertical unless you drop near the bottom of the view area, in which case the split will be horizontal; in the latter case, the bottom half of the view area is temporarily outlined to indicate that a horizontal split will occur.

<a name="Multiple_monitors"><p><b>Multiple monitors</b></a>
<p>Showing multiple views of the same document is more useful in a multiple monitor setup where each view has enough space to be fully utilized. The optimal setup is two identical monitors placed side by side and set to the same resolution, with the Windows desktop extended onto both monitors. In that case, you can resize the application's main window so that it fills both monitors. This is ideal for creating vertical <a href="../../Menus/Window/New_Window.htm#Splits">splits</a>.

<p>Multiple monitors of different sizes and resolutions can also be useful, for example you could place the application's main window on the larger monitor, and use the smaller monitor to show one or more <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Docking_windows.htm">docking windows</a>.
