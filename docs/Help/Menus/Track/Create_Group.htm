<h3>Group</h3>

<p>This command groups the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a> into a new part. The new part is named after its first member track, and appears in the <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Parts_bar.htm">Parts bar</a>.

<p>If any of the selected tracks already belong to part, a warning message is displayed, giving you the option to continue or cancel. If you continue, the offending tracks are removed from their previous part before being reassigned to the new one.
