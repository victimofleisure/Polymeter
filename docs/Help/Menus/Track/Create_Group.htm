<h3>Group</h3>

<p>This command groups the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a> into a new <a href="../../Concepts/Parts.htm">part</a>. The new part is named after its first member track, and appears in the <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Parts_bar.htm">Parts bar</a>.

<p>If any of the selected tracks already belong to a part, a warning <a href="../../Reference/Errors.htm#Group_Overlap">message</a> is displayed, giving you the option to continue or cancel. If you continue, the offending tracks are removed from their previous part before being reassigned to the new one.
