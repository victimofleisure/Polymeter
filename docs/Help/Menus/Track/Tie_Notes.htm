<h3>Tie Notes</h3>

<p>This command toggles a variable that determines whether the <a href="../../Concepts/Steps.htm">steps</a> of a <a href="../../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm">note track</a> are initially <a href="../../Tracks/Note_tracks.htm#Tied_notes">tied</a> or untied. When you left-click on an empty step, you may prefer the newly created note to be tied or untied, depending on the situation. If you're writing for an instrument that ignores note durations, as many drum machines do, you'll probably prefer notes to be untied by default. However if you're writing for a melodic instrument that respects note durations, you'll probably prefer notes to be tied by default. In either case you can achieve the opposite result by holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key while left-clicking, as the following table shows:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Tie Notes OFF</th><th>Tie Notes ON</th></tr>
<tr><th>left-click</th><td>Untied note</td><td>Tied note</td></tr>
<tr><th>Shift+left-click</th><td>Tied note</td><td>Untied note</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The command is available both from the Track menu and the <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Toolbar.htm">Toolbar</a>. Its icon resembles a flattened 'U', and if it's highlighted, Tie Notes is on, otherwise it's off. Only note tracks are affected by the Tie Notes state.
