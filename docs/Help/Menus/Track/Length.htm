<h3>Length</h3>

<p>This command lets you set the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Length">length</a> of a track visually instead of numerically. To set the length of a track:

<ol>
<li>Indicate the desired length by hovering the cursor over the location where the last step should be.
<li>Set the new length via the <span class="cmd">Track/Length</span> command or its shortcut <span class="key">Ctrl+L</span>.
</ol>

<p>Tracks can be shortened or lengthened using this method. If a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">track selection</a> exists, all of the selected tracks are set to the indicated length.

<p>If the cursor isn't over the step view, the error message "Cursor must be over track step to indicate desired length" is displayed.

<p>If a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">step selection</a> exists, it takes priority. In this case the track is shortened so the leftmost step of the step selection becomes the track's last step. If the step selection includes multiple tracks, they're all shortened.

<ol>
<li>Select the step that should be last. The step selection can span multiple tracks.
<li>Set the new length via the <span class="cmd">Track/Length</span> command or its shortcut <span class="key">Ctrl+L</span>.
</ol>
