<h3>Rotate</h3>

<p>These commands rotate tracks left or right by some number of steps. Rotation is similar to shifting, except that steps wrap around instead of falling off one end. For example, rotating 1234 right by one step yields 4123, because the 4 wraps around to the left. Rotation is a lossless, non-destructive operation. Shifting is also supported, via the <a href="../../Menus/Track/Shift.htm">shift</a> commands.

<p>If a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">step selection</a> exists, it takes priority. In this case only the selected steps are rotated. Otherwise the command operates on the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a> in their entirety.

<a name="Rotate_Left"><p><b>Rotate Left</b></a>
<p>This command rotates tracks one step to the left.

<a name="Rotate_Right"><p><b>Rotate Right</b></a>
<p>This command rotates tracks one step to the right.

<a name="Rotate_Steps"><p><b>Rotate Steps</b></a>
<p>This command rotates tracks by any amount. A dialog is displayed, prompting you for the desired rotation in steps. The rotation can be positive (right) or negative (left). After you press OK, the tracks are then rotated by the specified number of steps.

<a name="Offset_Tracks"><p><b>Offset Tracks</b></a>
<p>This command adds a specified amount to the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Grid.htm#Track_Offset">track offset</a> for the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a>. A dialog is displayed, prompting you for the desired offset change, in <a href="../../Concepts/Steps.htm#Ticks">ticks</a>. The change can be positive (later) or negative (earlier).
