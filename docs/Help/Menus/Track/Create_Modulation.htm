<h3>Modulation</h3>

<p>This command creates one or more <a href="../../Concepts/Modulations.htm">modulations</a> targeting the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a>. It's particularly useful for creating a group of modulators all having the same <a href="../../Concepts/Modulations.htm#Modulation_types">modulation type</a>, as in <a href="../../Modulation/Scale_modulation.htm">scale modulation</a> for example. Instead of creating the modulators one by one in the <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Modulations_bar.htm">modulations bar</a>, it's easier to create them all at once using this command.

<p>At least one track must be selected in the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">track view</a> for this command to be enabled, because the track selection determines which tracks will be modulated. The command displays a dialog, allowing you to select one or more source tracks and pick a modulation type. Press OK to create the modulations. For help with selecting multiple items, see <a href="../../Concepts/List_controls.htm">list controls</a>. It's recommended to keep the modulations bar visible while using this command so that you can see its effects. This command is also accessible via the <span class="cmd">Insert Group</span> item on the modulations bar's <a href="../../Docking_Windows/Modulations_bar.htm#Modulations_context_menu">context menu</a>.
