<h3>Sort</h3>

<p>This command sorts the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a>, or all tracks if none are selected. The command displays a dialog which allows you to specify up to three sort levels. Each sort level consists of a <a href="../../Concepts/Tracks.htm#Track_properties">track property</a> and a direction (ascending or descending). To disable a sort level, set its property to none.

<p>It's also possible to sort by ID. This puts the tracks in the order they were in when the document was opened. Any tracks added since then appear in the order they were added.

<p>Sorting tracks may have unintended effects, for example <a href="../../Modulation/Scale_modulation.htm">scale</a> and <a href="../../Modulation/Chord_modulation.htm">chord</a> modulators are potentially sensitive to track order.
