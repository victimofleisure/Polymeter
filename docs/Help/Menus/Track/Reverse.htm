<h3>Reverse</h3>

<p>This command reverses tracks. The order of the steps is reversed, for example 1234 becomes 4321.

<p>If a <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Step_Selection.htm">step selection</a> exists, it takes priority. In this case only the selected steps are reversed. Otherwise the command operates on the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_Selection.htm">selected tracks</a> in their entirety.
