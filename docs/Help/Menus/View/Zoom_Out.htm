<h3>Zoom Out</h3>

<p>This command zooms out of the center of the current view. It's supported by the <a href="../../Views/Track_View/Track_View.htm">Track View</a> and the <a href="../../Views/Song_View.htm">Song View</a>. In both cases only the horizontal axis is zoomed. To zoom at a location other than the center, move the pointer to the desired location and spin the mouse wheel down while pressing the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key. The track view's <a href="../../Options/View/Zoom_Step.htm">zoom step</a> is adjustable.
