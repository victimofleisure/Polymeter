74	05/10/18		bug	synchronized scrolling of track and step views can fail to line up, especially if velocity pane is showing		
189	09/07/18		bug	song edits sometimes leave fragments, especially if zoom is changed while editing		
272	01/26/19		bug	resizing docked pane via mouse drag leaves artifacts in Windows 10; affects stock VS2012 app too		
273	01/26/19		bug	resizing docked pane via mouse drag leaves gap between scroll bar and pane, when two or more documents exist; affects stock VS2012 app too		
297	11/04/19		bug	Graphviz times out if modulation is too complicated; introduce variable timeout option?		
298	11/12/19		bug	MDI tab control sometimes disappears after opening or closing document; hard to reproduce		
303	12/03/19		bug	playback lags behind UI by one tick (0.5 seconds) at tempo of 1 with GS Synth (see phase test)		
304	12/10/19		bug	steps aren't drawn when track's quant is very large (e.g. 30720) and step view is zoomed in		
319	03/04/20		bug	in step view, very long tracks aren't displayed when zoomed in; caused by scroll view's 32-bit limitations		
348	04/07/20		bug	stopping sequencer occasionally causes MIDI error 65 (still playing); happens every time in Mac Wine		
349	04/07/20		bug	attempting to open MIDI device that's already open gives misleading out of memory error message		
352	04/10/20		bug	sequencer sometimes takes too long; probable cause is time-critical winmm thread preempting sequencer callback		
358	04/17/20		bug	Time To Repeat command can take too long, stalling UI; show progress bar or use worker thread		
376	06/20/20		bug	undoing modulation edit doesn't restore modulation selection; can't without also restoring track selection and Show Differences state		
392	07/10/20		bug	Alt key commands don't work while cursor is hovering over MDI tab; affects stock VS2012 app too

581	01/22/24		bug	docking pane tabs don't connect to context help; framework bug		
605	07/31/25		bug	in export, tempo events could be added instead of inserted, because they're supposedly already in time order		
615	01/29/26		bug	all notes off internal controller triggers unexpectedly; should only trigger on transition from zero to non-zero value

18	03/22/18		hold	optional linear interpolation for controller tracks, with adjustable output density		
19	03/22/18		hold	radio groups; member tracks or parts automatically mute each other so that only one member sounds at a time		
20	03/22/18		hold	instrument groups; member tracks are grouped together in live view and combined into one track in MIDI export		
50	03/25/18		hold	animated visualization; Phase bar is a good start, but others?		
51	03/25/18		hold	playback can be slow to start, due to device open delay; keep output device open all the time?		
52	03/25/18		hold	output timing is unreliable at start of playback; likely only fixable by keeping output device open all the time		
53	04/09/18		hold	undoing/redoing track or step edit should ensure affected track is visible		
72	05/10/18		hold	right-click in step view background with no selection should show context menu?		
73	05/10/18		hold	left-click anywhere in step view should toggle selected steps or mutes, as in original app; too confusing?		
82	05/17/18		hold	installed app's shortcut icon has poor resolution; VS2008 installer bug, use WiX toolset instead?		
93	05/19/18		hold	note correction to chord changes, from ChordEase; poorly defined, pitch class sets would be more general		
99	05/21/18		hold	velocity pane visibility should be same for all documents?		
106	05/30/18		hold	song view needs different menus?		
113	06/04/18		hold	option to change track name font and thereby change track height		
114	06/04/18		hold	song view should indicate undersampling (multiple dubs per cell at current zoom)		
124	06/21/18		hold	track merge command; combine tracks that have identical settings and non-overlapping steps		
135	07/05/18		hold	command to change track, part and preset names to title case		
149	07/14/18		hold	channel volume sliders in live view; solving wrong problem?		
156	07/17/18		hold	live view list controls should have grid lines but default color is too bright; draw gridlines in custom draw?		
164	07/26/18		hold	live view should show approaching intersections between different loop lengths		
165	07/26/18		hold	transpose within selected key; only doable if selected tracks are all in that key?		
166	07/26/18		hold	in step view, steps should indicate whether track is muted; could be overdoing it, pink gives me a headache		
167	07/26/18		hold	command to shift selected steps up or down one or more tracks		
168	07/26/18		hold	replace steps, like paste but overwrite steps at insert position instead of shifting them; command or mode?		
181	07/30/18		hold	optional tool tip in step view showing step's position and value; position in what format? Step index?		
183	08/02/18		hold	mute tracks in song view; complicates sequencer and song view UI; easier to mute instruments in DAW		
193	09/17/18		hold	step zoom via Ctrl + mouse wheel doesn't work unless step view has focus; default OS behavior		
194	09/17/18		hold	in step view, add command to select all steps of selected tracks		
200	09/23/18		hold	ReadEnum should report undefined strings as errors? More accurate, but less robust		
201	09/25/18		hold	pan column in channels bar should show signed values; conflicts with use of -1 as unspecified value		
212	10/17/18		hold	in live view, dragging list selection beyond window boundaries should scroll list		
217	10/27/18		hold	switching from song view to live view doesn't always update parts list to reflect dub state? Hard to replicate		
236	11/19/18		hold	length modulation; cool idea but hard to implement and utility is questionable		Benoit
232	11/19/18		hold	not/invert operator for modulations; would allow a single modulator track to control a crossfade		Benoit
233	11/19/18		hold	highlight modulated parameters; complicates UI and doesn't fully capture modulation state		Benoit
234	11/19/18		hold	detail view of modulations that shows target as well as source and type; editable, sortable, clipboard		Benoit
235	11/19/18		hold	vertically fill the note column with values from a scale or chord		Benoit
257	12/09/18		hold	add hide/unhide column commands to track list header's context menu; where to store previous width?		
259	12/12/18		hold	grid control's header should display tooltip for truncated column names; must subclass header control?		
296	06/12/19		hold	option for space bar to start/stop playback without needing to also press Ctrl key; causes many UI conflicts		
318	03/02/20		hold	separate window for viewing/editing recorded MIDI input		
340	04/04/20		hold	scale modulation often repeats same work for each track that uses the scale; but not always!		
344	04/05/20		hold	Step Values bar doesn't allow arbitrary rectangular selection; grid control limitation, custom view?		
347	04/06/20		hold	extend sequence lead-in to fix initial timing glitch; multiply m_nCBLen in GetPosition and Play		
353	04/10/20		hold	post-voicing sort could be replaced with insert sorted, but benchmarking shows little room for improvement		
354	04/11/20		hold	channel modulation; but is it really necessary? Same effect is achievable with mute modulations		
355	04/11/20		hold	window that shows current song time in huge font; excessive?		
370	05/27/20		hold	force MIDI thru to a specified channel; useful for controllers that lack channel setting, but complicates MidiInProc		
372	06/08/20		hold	song view should show loop lengths and their convergences graphically, possibly in a separate timeline pane		
383	07/01/20		hold	add more input quants; possibly useful with larger time divisions		
393	07/17/20		hold	switching to song view should set all mutes to match song's current dub state (chase); must be synchronous		
396	07/22/20		hold	transition from one document to another without stopping playback; conflicts with recording implementation		
402	08/05/20		hold	indicate step selection in Step view's velocities pane		
403	08/22/20		hold	preset track type, interpreting step value as preset index; requires moving preset array into sequencer		
405	08/22/20		hold	in mapping, add Note Number input event type: get data value from note's index, ignoring velocity and note off		
410	09/28/20		hold	live view position bars for track groups should reflect LCM of periods instead of maximum period; could be slow		
416	10/20/20		hold	Graphviz PDF output looks better than SVG (if Adobe is installed) but it overrides our context menu		
431	01/13/21		hold	device change notification should retry missing MIDI device and close message box if successful		
434	01/19/21		hold	graph should optionally indicate track type		
433	01/19/21		hold	track should be a potential mapping source, so tracks can automate parameters; inject MIDI event?		
437	01/20/21		hold	add harmonizer and harmonic anticipation, adapted from ChordEase		
452	06/24/21		hold	optional song metadata; title, author, website, email, license, comments		
462	08/31/21		hold	dialog that allows song dubs to be edited directly; complex because each track stores its own dubs		
477	11/13/21		hold	modulation types filter dialog should be modeless or at least have a preview option		
494	01/18/22		hold	insert modulators command; create appropriately initialized modulator track(s) of specified type		
503	02/01/22		hold	indicate MIDI input activity in the status bar; per-channel indicators would be helpful too		
510	02/13/22		hold	in Wine, Phase bar doesn't work at all, likely due to its use of Direct2D		Wine
511	02/13/22		hold	in Wine, HTML help's Contents and Index tabs are empty, but Search works and all topics are present		Wine
512	02/13/22		hold	in Wine, MIDI devices added while app is running don't appear until the app is exited and restarted		Wine
519	06/07/22		hold	optionally group tracks by MIDI channel in Live view, with each group in its own list and group muting		
522	06/17/22		hold	indicate step or cell selection in status bar, depending on which view has focus		
525	06/21/22		hold	Step view and Step Values bar should mirror each other's selection if possible		
533	09/05/22		hold	overlay preset; save mute states of selected tracks only, and affect only those tracks when preset is applied		
554	01/20/23		hold	phase bar lacks command to export still image; workaround is export one-second video with frame rate of 1		
555	01/21/23		hold	to support large offset modulations, add a scaling factor that source step values are multiplied by		
559	02/19/23		hold	view timer is extremely inaccurate; add option to use multimedia timer, possibly with drift compensation		
561	02/20/23		hold	graph should optionally indicate muted tracks, but how?		
564	02/28/23		hold	graph font should be configurable; what about font size? Helvetica has special meaning in Graphviz		
567	05/10/23		hold	in track fill, add bias and amplitude options, or remove fill dialog's value range limits		
578	01/05/24		hold	allow meter denominators other than four, limited to small powers of two		
587	02/23/24		hold	add phase bar mode that only shows selected tracks; see notes for disadvantages		
593	04/04/24		hold	Step Values bar should scroll to current position if possible; could be distracting, make it optional?		
596	08/28/24		hold	phase bar should optionally show period labels above ellipses; labels would be blocked by convergences		
597	08/31/24		hold	controlling tempo range via integer percentage is too coarse for accurate rests; need at least 1000ths of a percent		
21	03/22/18		punt	swing modulation; achievable with offset modulation so no need		
83	05/17/18		punt	in velocity pane, left-click on tooltip causes app to flash; all tooltips do this, derived tooltip doesn't help		
100	05/21/18		punt	scroll positions should persist in document; more trouble than it's worth		
119	06/08/18		punt	untying note should set all steps to velocity of original tied note; better to preserve velocity		
198	09/18/18		punt	modulation dubbing is sensitive to track order at longer latencies; also affects export		
237	11/19/18		punt	step copy/cut/paste should support non-rectangular step selection; incompatible with step view design		Benoit
238	11/19/18		punt	list view selection is hard to see when list doesn't have focus; curse at Microsoft or change theme		Benoit
239	11/19/18		punt	sort on note name without octave; not sure why this is useful		Benoit
240	11/21/18		punt	while drawing velocities in velocity pane, dragging left/right of window should scroll view; tried it, too confusing		
264	01/11/19		punt	in Piano view, if multiple instances of a note overlap, velocity color may be inaccurate; unavoidable		
286	02/28/19		punt	song playback doesn't always match live output when modulator tracks have big quants; dub granularity issue		
294	05/30/19		punt	modulation list is empty regardless of track selection; can't reproduce it, brain fire?		
301	11/12/19		punt	popup edit of step's velocity value, via Ctrl + right click on step; tried it, step grid view would be more useful		
468	10/30/21		punt	at refresh rate of 60 Hz or above, song view cursor flickers during playback if track count is five or less		
476	11/13/21		punt	render phase diagram in 3D, with variable lighting, texture and rotation of orbital plane; simulated 3D is enough		
483	11/16/21		punt	docking windows submenu doesn't support selection via mnemonics; framework issue, BuildPanesMenu		
556	01/21/23		punt	resize live view's progress bar via left-click drag; conflicts with primary function of left-click		
577	12/29/23		punt	add option to ignore sequencer errors during playback; no need now that callback overrun is only a warning		
579	01/15/24		punt	Check Modulations should report unused modulators; dubious as they're not actually an error		
592	04/04/24		punt	Create Modulation dialog should have types on the left and tracks on the right, to match modulations bar column order		
607	01/11/26		todo	add notes view showing output note sequence in piano roll format		
613	01/23/26		todo	pitch bend should support LSB somehow; wheel modulation?
